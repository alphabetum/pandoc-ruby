# Indent access modifiers like `protected` and `private`.

# Style/FileName
#
# Long, long ago, this was named with a dash rather than an underscore. Now
# it's unconventional, but let's consider it retro and leave it for now so we
# don't have to rename the gem. TODO: Rename using an underscore.

    - 'lib/pandoc-ruby.rb'

# Style/IndentationConsistency
#
# Use Rails-style access modifier indentation.
#
# Example:
# ```
# class Foo
#   def bar
#     puts 'bar'
#   end
#
#   private
#
#     def baz
#       puts 'baz'
#     end
# end
# ```

# Style/RedundantSelf
#
# Explicit `self` is currently preferred in this project in order to
# better distinguish between accessors and local variables.
